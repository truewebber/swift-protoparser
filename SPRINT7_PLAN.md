# Sprint 7: Custom Options Support and Test Coverage Completion

## Overview

This sprint has two main focuses:
1. Implementing support for custom options in the SwiftProtoParser library
2. Completing test coverage for all acceptance criteria from previous sprints

Custom options are a powerful feature of Protocol Buffers that allow extending the protocol with user-defined options at various levels (file, message, field, enum, etc.). Additionally, we need to ensure that all acceptance criteria from previous sprints are properly covered by unit tests.

| Compatibility with protoc output | High | Medium | Create comprehensive comparison tests |
| Performance impact | Medium | Low | Profile and optimize as needed |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Clearly define MVP and stick to it |
| Test coverage gaps | High | Medium | Use code coverage tools to identify untested code |
| Time constraints due to additional test coverage work | High | High | Prioritize critical components and consider extending sprint duration if necessary |
