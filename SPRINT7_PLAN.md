# Sprint 7: Custom Options Support

## Overview

This sprint focuses on implementing support for custom options in the SwiftProtoParser library. Custom options are a powerful feature of Protocol Buffers that allow extending the protocol with user-defined options at various levels (file, message, field, enum, etc.).

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: TBD
- **End Date**: TBD (2 weeks after start)
- **Review Date**: TBD (1 day after end)

## Goals

1. Implement full support for parsing custom options in proto3 files
2. Validate custom options according to proto3 rules
3. Generate correct descriptor representations for custom options
4. Provide comprehensive tests and documentation for custom options

## User Stories

### 1. AST Node Types for Custom Options

**Description**: As a developer, I want to define AST node types for custom options so that I can represent option definitions.

**Tasks**:
- Create or extend OptionNode to support custom option syntax
- Add support for option extensions
- Implement proper source location tracking for custom options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AST nodes can represent all forms of custom options
- AST nodes include source location information
- AST nodes can be properly serialized and deserialized

### 2. Parser Support for Custom Options

**Description**: As a developer, I want to parse option definitions so that I can support custom options.

**Tasks**:
- Extend Parser.swift to handle custom option syntax
- Support parsing option extensions
- Handle nested option fields
- Support all primitive types in option values

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Parser can handle custom options with parentheses: `option (custom.option) = value;`
- Parser can handle nested option fields: `option (custom.option).field = value;`
- Parser correctly handles all primitive types in option values
- Parser provides meaningful error messages for invalid custom options

### 3. Multi-level Option Support

**Description**: As a developer, I want to support options at all levels so that I can customize behavior at different scopes.

**Tasks**:
- Implement support for file-level custom options
- Implement support for message-level custom options
- Implement support for field-level custom options
- Implement support for enum-level custom options
- Implement support for enum value-level custom options
- Implement support for service-level custom options
- Implement support for method-level custom options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Custom options can be applied at all supported levels
- Options are correctly associated with their respective elements
- Options can be retrieved from their respective elements

### 4. Option Type Resolution

**Description**: As a developer, I want to resolve option types so that I can validate option values.

**Tasks**:
- Extend SymbolTable to track option extensions
- Implement resolution of option extension types
- Handle imported option extensions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Option types can be resolved from the symbol table
- Option types from imported files are correctly resolved
- Meaningful error messages are provided for unresolved option types

### 5. Option Value Validation

**Description**: As a developer, I want to validate option values so that they match their defined types.

**Tasks**:
- Implement validation for option values against their types
- Handle repeated and map options
- Validate nested option fields

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Option values are validated against their defined types
- Repeated and map options are correctly validated
- Nested option fields are correctly validated
- Meaningful error messages are provided for invalid option values

### 6. Descriptor Generation for Custom Options

**Description**: As a developer, I want to generate Protocol Buffer descriptors for custom options so that they can be used with Swift Protobuf.

**Tasks**:
- Update DescriptorGenerator to handle custom options
- Generate UninterpretedOption objects for custom options
- Support all option types and values

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Custom options are correctly represented in generated descriptors
- UninterpretedOption objects are correctly generated
- All option types and values are supported
- Generated descriptors match protoc output for the same input

### 7. Testing and Documentation

**Description**: As a developer, I want comprehensive tests and documentation for custom options so that I can ensure they work correctly and users know how to use them.

**Tasks**:
- Create unit tests for custom option parsing
- Create unit tests for custom option validation
- Create unit tests for custom option descriptor generation
- Create integration tests comparing output with protoc
- Update documentation to include custom options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Unit tests cover >90% of custom options code
- Integration tests verify compatibility with protoc
- Documentation includes examples of using custom options
- README is updated to mention custom options support

## Dependencies

- Protocol Buffer descriptor.proto file (for understanding option extensions)
- Existing AST node structure
- Existing Parser implementation
- Existing Validator implementation
- Existing DescriptorGenerator implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex syntax for nested options | Medium | High | Break down parsing into smaller, testable steps |
| Compatibility with protoc output | High | Medium | Create comprehensive comparison tests |
| Performance impact | Medium | Low | Profile and optimize as needed |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Clearly define MVP and stick to it |

## Definition of Done

- All user stories are implemented and meet acceptance criteria
- Code is well-tested with >90% test coverage
- Documentation is updated to include custom options
- All tests pass, including integration tests with protoc
- Code is reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Performance impact is acceptable
