# Sprint 8: Extensions Support

## Overview

This sprint focuses on implementing support for extensions in the SwiftProtoParser library. Extensions are a key feature of Protocol Buffers that allow extending existing message types with new fields without modifying the original definition. This feature is particularly important for maintaining backward compatibility and for integrating with third-party proto files.

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: March 16, 2025
- **End Date**: March 30, 2025
- **Review Date**: March 31, 2025
- **Status**: COMPLETED âœ…

## Goals

1. Implement full support for parsing extension definitions in proto3 files
2. Implement support for using extensions in options
3. Validate extension field numbers and types according to proto3 rules
4. Generate correct descriptor representations for extensions
5. Provide comprehensive tests and documentation for extensions

## User Stories

### 1. AST Node Types for Extensions

**Description**: As a developer, I want to define AST node types for extensions so that I can represent extension definitions.

**Tasks**:
- Create ExtensionNode to represent extension definitions
- Add support for extension field types
- Implement proper source location tracking for extensions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AST nodes can represent all forms of extension definitions
- AST nodes include source location information
- AST nodes can be properly serialized and deserialized

**Status**: COMPLETED

### 2. Parser Support for Extensions

**Description**: As a developer, I want to parse extension definitions so that I can support extending existing messages.

**Tasks**:
- Extend Parser.swift to handle extension syntax
- Support parsing extension field definitions
- Handle extension field types and options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Parser can handle extension definitions: `extend Message { ... }`
- Parser correctly parses extension fields with types and options
- Parser provides meaningful error messages for invalid extensions

**Status**: COMPLETED

### 3. Extension Usage in Options

**Description**: As a developer, I want to support using extensions in options so that I can customize behavior.

**Tasks**:
- Extend option parsing to handle extension references
- Implement resolution of extension references in options
- Support nested extension references

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Options can reference extensions
- Extension references are correctly resolved
- Nested extension references are supported

**Status**: COMPLETED

### 4. Extension Field Validation

**Description**: As a developer, I want to validate extension field numbers and types so that they are valid.

**Tasks**:
- Implement validation for extension field numbers
- Implement validation for extension field types
- Validate compatibility with extended message

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Extension field numbers are validated against valid ranges
- Extension field types are validated for compatibility
- Meaningful error messages are provided for invalid extensions

**Status**: COMPLETED

### 5. Descriptor Generation for Extensions

**Description**: As a developer, I want to generate Protocol Buffer descriptors for extensions so that they can be used with Swift Protobuf.

**Tasks**:
- Update DescriptorGenerator to handle extensions
- Generate FieldDescriptorProto objects for extension fields
- Support all extension types and options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Extensions are correctly represented in generated descriptors
- Extension fields are correctly generated
- Generated descriptors match protoc output for the same input

**Status**: COMPLETED

### 6. Testing and Documentation for Extensions

**Description**: As a developer, I want comprehensive tests and documentation for extensions so that I can ensure they work correctly and users know how to use them.

**Tasks**:
- Create unit tests for extension parsing
- Create unit tests for extension validation
- Create unit tests for extension descriptor generation
- Create integration tests comparing output with protoc
- Update documentation to include extensions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Unit tests cover >90% of extensions code
- Integration tests verify compatibility with protoc
- Documentation includes examples of using extensions
- README is updated to mention extensions support

**Status**: COMPLETED

## Dependencies

- Protocol Buffer descriptor.proto file (for understanding extension syntax)
- Existing AST node structure
- Existing Parser implementation
- Existing Validator implementation
- Existing DescriptorGenerator implementation
- Existing SourceInfoGenerator implementation
- Existing Configuration implementation
- Existing public API implementation
- Custom options support from Sprint 7 (for integration with extensions)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complexity of extension syntax | Medium | Medium | Break down parsing into smaller, testable steps |
| Compatibility with protoc output | High | Medium | Create comprehensive comparison tests |
| Performance impact | Medium | Low | Profile and optimize as needed |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Clearly define MVP and stick to it |
| Integration with custom options | High | Medium | Ensure proper testing of interactions between extensions and options |
| Proto2 vs. Proto3 differences | High | High | Clearly document limitations and differences in extension support between proto versions |

## Definition of Done

- All user stories are implemented and meet acceptance criteria
- All acceptance criteria are covered by unit tests
- Code is well-tested with >90% test coverage
- Documentation is updated to include extensions
- All tests pass, including integration tests with protoc
- Code is reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Performance impact is acceptable
