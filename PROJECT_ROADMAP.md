# SwiftProtoParser Project Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for the SwiftProtoParser library, organized into iterations following Scrum principles. Each iteration represents a potentially shippable increment of the product with specific goals and tasks.

## Project Overview

SwiftProtoParser is a Swift library for parsing Protocol Buffer (proto3) files into protocol buffer descriptors. The library aims to provide functionality similar to Google's protoc tool, but implemented in pure Swift.

## Development Approach

We will follow an iterative approach with 2-week sprints. Each sprint will focus on delivering specific features that build upon previous work. This approach allows us to:

1. Deliver working increments of the library
2. Get early feedback on core functionality
3. Adapt to changing requirements
4. Maintain high code quality through continuous testing and refactoring

## Post-Release Considerations

After the initial release, consider the following for future development:

1. Support for proto2 syntax
2. Code generation capabilities
3. Performance optimizations
4. Integration with popular Swift frameworks
5. GUI tools or IDE plugins

## Risk Management

Throughout the project, maintain a risk register and regularly review:

1. Technical risks (e.g., performance issues, compatibility problems)
2. Schedule risks (e.g., underestimated complexity)
3. Resource risks (e.g., knowledge gaps, availability)

Mitigate risks through:
1. Regular code reviews
2. Continuous integration and testing
3. Frequent demos and feedback
4. Technical spikes for unknown areas

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the SwiftProtoParser library. By following this plan and adapting as needed, we can deliver a high-quality library that meets all requirements while maintaining good engineering practices.

The roadmap should be reviewed and updated at the end of each sprint to reflect current progress and any changes in requirements or understanding.
