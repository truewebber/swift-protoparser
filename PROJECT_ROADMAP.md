# SwiftProtoParser Project Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for the SwiftProtoParser library, organized into iterations following Scrum principles. Each iteration represents a potentially shippable increment of the product with specific goals and tasks.

## Project Overview

SwiftProtoParser is a Swift library for parsing Protocol Buffer (proto3) files into protocol buffer descriptors. The library aims to provide functionality similar to Google's protoc tool, but implemented in pure Swift.

## Development Approach

We will follow an iterative approach with 2-week sprints. Each sprint will focus on delivering specific features that build upon previous work. This approach allows us to:

1. Deliver working increments of the library
2. Get early feedback on core functionality
3. Adapt to changing requirements
4. Maintain high code quality through continuous testing and refactoring
