## üéâ Recent Progress (Current Session) - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH

### Achievements
- **Coverage breakthrough**: 88.52% ‚Üí 90.27% regions (+1.75%)
- **Parser.swift major improvement**: 72.14% ‚Üí 79.82% regions (+7.68%)
- **Missed regions reduced**: 90 ‚Üí 69 in Parser.swift (-21 regions!)
- **Lines coverage**: 91.71% ‚Üí 93.28% (+1.57%)

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS:**

1. **Map Type Parsing** - ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING
   - All map types: `map<string, int32>`, `map<bool, double>`, etc.
   - Proper whitespace handling in parseMapType()
   - Full integration with message declarations
   - Tests: All map tests now passing

2. **Reserved Field Parsing** - ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING  
   - Reserved numbers: `reserved 1, 2, 3;`
   - Reserved ranges: `reserved 1 to 5;` with validation
   - Reserved names: `reserved "old_field", "deprecated_field";`
   - Mixed declarations support
   - Tests: All reserved tests now passing

3. **Scalar Type Field Parsing** - ‚úÖ WORKING
   - All scalar keywords (double, float, int32, etc.) recognized as field types
   - Integrated in both message and oneof contexts
   - parseMessageDeclaration() enhanced to handle scalar keywords

### üîÑ **Partially Working (needs completion):**
- **Oneof parsing**: Structure exists but field parsing inside oneof fails
  - parseOneofDeclaration() implemented but has field declaration issues
  - Error: "Expected: oneof element" when parsing oneof fields

### Technical Achievements
- **Fixed whitespace handling** throughout parser methods
- **Enhanced parseMessageDeclaration()** for map/scalar keyword support
- **Implemented parseMapType()** with full functionality
- **Implemented parseReservedDeclaration()** with range support
- **Added comprehensive skipIgnorableTokens()** calls

### New Test Suites Status
1. **ParserErrorPathTests.swift** (25 tests) ‚úÖ
2. **ParserSpecificCoverageTests.swift** (updated, passing) ‚úÖ
3. **ASTCoverageBoostTests.swift** (9 tests) ‚úÖ
4. **ParserAdvancedTests.swift** (updated, passing) ‚úÖ

**Removed**: Tests that expected parsing failures but now work correctly

- **Advanced parser error handling** (targeting remaining error paths)
- **Service method streaming** support completeness
- **Custom option parsing** edge cases

### üìã Architecture Quality

## Next Steps Priority

### To Reach 95% Coverage Goal
**Remaining gap**: 4.73% (95% - 90.27%)

1. **Complete Oneof Implementation** (Priority #1)
   - Debug oneof field parsing logic
   - Fix "oneof element" parsing errors
   - Expected coverage gain: ~15-20 regions
   - Target: Parser.swift 79.82% ‚Üí 85%+

2. **Improve Error Path Coverage** (Priority #2)
   - Target remaining error handling scenarios in Parser.swift
   - Focus on edge cases and exception paths
   - Expected coverage gain: ~10-15 regions

3. **ServiceNode & FieldNode Improvements** (Priority #3)
   - Address remaining 8 missed regions in ServiceNode.swift
   - Address remaining 5 missed regions in FieldNode.swift
   - Expected coverage gain: ~13 regions

### Strategic Approach
- **Feature completion** over just coverage metrics
- **Quality-focused** implementation of remaining parser features
- **Targeted testing** for specific uncovered regions

---

## Development Insights

### Test Coverage Patterns
- **Lexer module**: Excellent coverage (95%+) - robust foundation
- **Core module**: Near-perfect coverage (98%+) - solid infrastructure  
- **Parser module**: Major improvement (82.61% ‚Üí 85.95%) - complex logic with progress on edge cases
- **Public API**: Good coverage (91%+) - well-tested interface

### Quality Indicators
- **All 522 tests passing** - no regressions introduced
- **Major functionality working** - map and reserved parsing operational
- **Comprehensive error handling** - multiple error scenarios tested
- **API stability** - consistent interface across test iterations

### Technical Debt - **Significantly Reduced**
- **Map type parsing** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Reserved field parsing** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **Oneof parsing** - üîÑ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (needs field parsing fix)
- Some parser error paths still unreachable through public API
- Complex option parsing has some gaps

---

## Recommendations

### For 95% Coverage - **Updated Strategy**
1. **Debug and complete oneof field parsing** - highest impact potential
2. **Target specific error paths** in Parser.swift remaining regions
3. **Address ServiceNode and FieldNode** specific coverage gaps
4. **Comprehensive edge case testing** for implemented features

### For Production Readiness
1. **Complete oneof parsing** for full Protocol Buffers compliance
2. **Performance testing** with large Protocol Buffers files
3. **Compatibility testing** with real-world .proto files
4. **Documentation completion** for all public APIs

**Current Assessment**: The project has made major strides toward 95% coverage. With map and reserved parsing fully working, and oneof parsing structurally ready, achieving the 95% goal is well within reach through focused oneof completion and targeted error path testing.
