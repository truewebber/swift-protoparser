### Areas for Future Improvement

While we achieved good coverage in several components, there are areas that need attention in future sprints:

1. **Validator (51.8% line coverage)**: The validator has many complex rules that need more thorough testing.
   - **SemanticValidator (3% coverage)**: This component needs comprehensive tests.
   - **OptionValidator (30% coverage)**: This component needs more thorough testing.
   - **ReferenceValidator (34% coverage)**: This component needs more thorough testing.

2. **Public API (64.4% line coverage)**: The public API needs more comprehensive testing, especially focusing on edge cases and error handling.

3. **Descriptor Generation (70.5% line coverage)**: While function coverage is excellent (97.0%), line coverage could be improved with more comprehensive tests.

## Conclusion

Sprint 9 has significantly improved the test coverage of the SwiftProtoParser project, particularly for the Symbol Resolution component, the ServiceNode, ExtendNode, MessageNode, and Error Handling. The comprehensive test suite now provides confidence in the correctness of these components and will help prevent regressions in future development.

The overall project coverage has improved from 48.8% to 50.6%, showing steady progress toward our target of >95% coverage.

## Next Steps

For future sprints, we recommend:
1. Focusing on the components with the lowest coverage (SemanticValidator, OptionValidator, ReferenceValidator)
2. Improving the coverage of the Public API component
3. Adding tests for error recovery mechanisms
4. Implementing performance tests for large files
5. Setting up continuous integration to automatically run tests and report coverage
